Hello world! My name is Danica and I am a linguist with an MSc degree in Natural Language Processing with 2+ years of work experience in analytics.

### Why data?
When I read Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow", I came accross the gist of his research with Amos Tversky:
<i>People are intuitively bad statisticians.</i> Even statisticians are intuitively bad at statistics. This is why I like data: it gives us more reliable answers, which often happen to be misaligned with our previous perceptions of the problem at hand.  

### Work

I work at Vast.com where I make magic using neural networks on Computer Vision projects and car data. I interact with both structured and unstructured data daily: asking questions, looking for answers, automating whatever can be automated, evaluating, processing, maintaining models... No day is ever the same.

### Education

I am a philologist and computational linguist. I can talk about Balzac's La Com√©die humaine, formal grammars and write code in python. I am also pursuing a phD degree in Artificial Intelligence with focus on NLP. Still searching for the research topic.
